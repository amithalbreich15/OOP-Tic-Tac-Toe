Explanation about Player Strategy:
WhateverPlayer - whatever player places his mark randomly by picking a random row and col indices from the range of
the board's given size, first it looks for all the BLANK Spots and only then selects one of the available spots
randomly.

CleverPlayer - clever player places its mark on the next available and valid coordinate on the game board according to
rows (in order of a "nested 2 loops" loop) that first covers rows, will skip taken coordinates which aren't available.

GeniusPlayer - Genius player will first try to block other opponent's win streak (for rows first) if he is starting 2nd.
this is a defending strategy. If genius starts the game (I check if all marks on the board are blank) he will try to put
the marks on the Diagonal main line and if he gets blocked by clever or what ever he will try to put his mark
vertically to create a streak. If none of the above happens he will put a mark in a random coordinate on the board.
If genius starts second and he already blocked the opponent (he will try to block clever's horizontal streak) he will
try to create his own diagonal or vertical streak in order to win.

Q: What is The advantage in Program Design in the way that each one of the Player Classes implements a shared interface?
A: The advantages in such Program Design is that if we have a lot of Objects/Classes that are not exactly the same
but they share a lot of common characteristics and share a lot of common abilities we can put them under same
Interface because they are closely related and has the same methods. e.g they can do the same actions so they will share
common methods but will do them a bit differently per class.
In our case each one of the player types has to have the Method playTurn because they all need to take their turn
but each player has a different strategy which differs from the others and using Interfaces allow it to happen :)
