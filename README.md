# OOP-Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is about implementing a customizable Tic-Tac-Toe tournament. The game board can be any size between 2x2 and 9x9, and a player wins by achieving a streak of their mark in a row, column, or diagonal. The game supports both human and automated players, with different AI strategies to ensure competitive gameplay.
